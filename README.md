Thank You For Purchasing Asbestosstar's Browser Floppy 1 Edition, Here I Will Cover What the browser does, How You Would Update It, and all other stuff.


This Is a Fork Of Asbestosstar's Web Browser Which is desgined to run on older computers and sell on Floppy Discs. We Plan to move the Origniall Asbestosstar's Browser to the Gecko Browser Runtime, while the floppy fork will stay on the
current runtime. The Current Runtime is of IE 7. It is reccomended that you have the latest Version of Internet Explorer on your computer for this browser to be at its best. This Browser is not Reccomended For Computers With Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Higher, for This We Will Reccomend our Main Fork.
The Reason For Keeping The Runtime for This Fork of That Of IE's is to Keep Low System Requirements.

The System Requirents For This Software are the  Same As For .NET 1.1.

The Web Browser Partially Uses Runtime From your Computers IE, so its bets to have then newest version.

.Net FrameWork 1.1 (Included ON CD)
Around 80 MegaBytes For .Net FrameWork
16-32 MegaBytes Reccomended in RAM (Though, not Many Modern Web Pages Will Run Well on THAT)
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 7/6A Or Windows 98 Or Higher (For Windows 95 you need unofficial .Net backport https://github.com/itsmattkc/dotnet9x)
Internet Connection
Floppy Port(If You Bought This on a floppy Disc)
CD/DVD Drive(If YOu Bought This on CD or Are Installing .NET from a CD)
Most DVD drives support CDs

The Browser View Web Pages And Performance depend on A little on OS


What Will You Get

You Will Get a 3.5 Inch Floppy Disc With The Browser On it, If You Want To Install it, just Copy The Folder inside, and then drop it in the Location you want it to be on.

A CD  with the .NET FRAMEWORK Installer And Windows Installer 1.1. The File was too large so we had to Give It on a CD.
